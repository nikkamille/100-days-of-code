# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I started the 30-Day Vanilla JavaScript Coding Challenge today. I completed the first one which is a JS drum kit. 

**Thoughts:** I'm going back to the basics of JavaScript because I feel like I need to strengthen the foundation I have.

### Day 2: June 16, 2021 (3:43 am)

**Today's Progress**: I created a JS and CSS Clock by following the 2nd project of the 30-Day Vanilla JavaScript Coding Challenge.

**Thoughts**: Seems simple enough but I want to practice more.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
