# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I started the 30-Day Vanilla JavaScript Coding Challenge today. I completed the first one which is a JS drum kit. 

**Thoughts:** I'm going back to the basics of JavaScript because I feel like I need to strengthen the foundation I have.

### Day 6: June 22, 2021 (1am)

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Duplicate Zeros problem by using the splice() and pop() methods.

**Thoughts** I still take a long time to solve a problem. I need to study algorithms and data structures more.
